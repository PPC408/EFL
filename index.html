        One day of winter season we were at home watching TV, it was drizzling  and breezing.  <br>
        Suddently it's started pouring , it was freezing outside a sub-zero temperature . We decided to turn on the heaters. <br> 
        After this storm the weather was likely changeable  it started drizzling  and the sky being to be clear  and bright again, the temerature was full. I'm not so keen on mild weather, it become realy hot know! <br>
        The first two days it was so over-cast and suny. <br>
        Well in the winter the temperature can be very hot like very cool, I prefere when the weather is dramatic. <br>
        <br>
        It's tricky how the weither can change in a short time like this! <br> <br> For more texts contact: Joke xD
